## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. AI-Powered Locality Detection with Smart Fallback
The system uses a robust dual-AI approach:
- **Primary**: Groq API (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) for fast, accurate locality identification
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamlessly switches to Gemini 1.5 Flash if Groq encounters issues

- **Breaks the 10-Result Barrier**: Most scrapers get stuck at Google's default 10 results
- **Achieves 120+ Results**: Systematically loads all available businesses in the area
- **Infinite Scroll Capability**: Continues until the actual end of results is reached
- **Smart Progress Monitoring**: Tracks venue count increases (10→50→120→beyond)
- **End-Point Detection**: Automatically recognizes "You've reached the end" messages
- **Dynamic Waiting**: Adjusts wait times based on content loading patterns

### 3. Comprehensive Data Extraction
Extracts key business information:
- **Business Name**: Complete business names
- **Category**: Business type/industry classification
- **Location**: Full address or area description
- **Phone Number**: Contact information when available

## 🖥️ Usage

### Basic Usage

   - Scroll maps to load all results
   - Extract and save data to CSV

### Example Session
```
Enter your city name: Jaipur
Enter your query: mobile shops

🤖 Commercial Localities for Jaipur: MI Road, Raja Park, Vaishali Nagar, Malviya Nagar, Tonk Road

🌐 Loading Google Maps...
✅ Google Maps loaded!

📜 PHASE 1: SCROLLING
🚀 Starting Google Maps scroll

⏱️ Delay between scrolls: 4.0s

📜 Scroll 1/20
📊 Current venues: 10 → Loading more...

📜 Scroll 5/20  
📊 Current venues: 50 → Still loading...

📜 Scroll 12/20
📊 Current venues: 120 → Found all available results!

🏁 Reached end of results!
🎉 Scrolling completed with 120+ venues loaded!

🕷️ PHASE 2: EXTRACTING DATA
✅ Successfully extracted 145 venues
📁 Results saved to: mobile+shops_Jaipur_venues.csv
```

## 📊 Output Format

The scraper generates CSV files with the following structure:

|----------|----------|------|-------|
| Cell phone store | MI Road, Jaipur | Samsung Experience Store | 098292 59498 |
| Mobile repair shop | Raja Park | Mobile Doctor | 070234 97097 |

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Scroll Settings (in main.py)
```python
max_scrolls = 20        # Maximum scroll attempts
scroll_delay = 4.0      # Delay between scrolls (seconds)
```

### AI Provider Selection with Automatic Fallback
The system implements intelligent provider switching:
```python
# Automatic fallback system
for provider in ["groq", "gemini"]:
    try:
        bot = ReplyGenerator(provider)
        reply = bot.generate_reply(city)
        if reply:
            break  # Success - use this provider
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Falling back from {provider}...")
        # Automatically tries next provider
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### 🔄 **Automatic AI Fallback System**
- **Primary Provider**: Groq (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) - Fast and efficient
- **Backup Provider**: Gemini 1.5 Flash - Reliable fallback when Groq is unavailable
- **Zero-Downtime Switching**: Seamlessly transitions between providers without user intervention
- **Error Recovery**: Intelligent retry mechanisms ensure continuous operation

### 📈 **Google Maps Scrolling Breakthrough**
